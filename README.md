# Knights Tour Presentation

This is a 20 minute presentation I gave to math students at Highline Community College in Des Moines, WA in February of 2015.  The goal was to expose the students to abstract mathmatics and proofs while keeping it interesting and applicable to real life.

I used Beamer in LaTeX to write the slides, and projected them while writing proofs and examples on the whiteboard.
